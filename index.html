                        React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.It is the view layer for web applications.In React you can write your html directly(not directly but in the form of JSX more about it later) in your javascript code.React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug. Some of the features of React:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Fast</li>
                          <li>Efficient</li>
                          <li>Easy to Debug</li>
                          <li>Declarative</li>
                          <li>Scalable</li>
                      </ul>
                      </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="main-section" id="Intro_to_JSX">
                      <header>Intro to JSX</header>
                      <p>
                        As we have told above that React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. But instead of using regular JavaScript, React code should be written in something called JSX.
              <br><br>
              Let us see a sample JSX code:
                        <br><br>
                      <code>var element = &lt;H1&gt;This is sample JSX&lt;/H1&gt;</code>
                        <br><br>
                        The above code snippet somewhat looks like HTML and it also uses a JavaScript-like variable but is neither of HTML or JavaScript, it is JSX. JSX is basically a syntax extension of regular JavaScript and is used to create React elements. 
                        <br>
                        n React we are allowed to use normal JavaScript expressions with JSX. To embed any javascript expression in a piece of code written in JSX we will have to wrap that expression in curly braces {}.
                        <br><br>
                      <pre>
                      <code>var name = "learner"
              var element = &lt;H1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/H1&gt;</code></pre>
                        <br><br>
                        
                      </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="main-section" id="ReactDOM">
                      <header>ReactDOM</header>
                      <p>
                        Until now we learned that we can use JSX to store HTML markups within Javascript variables. Now, ReactJS is a library to build active User Interfaces thus rendering is one of the integral parts of ReactJS. React provides the developers with a package react-dom a.k.a ReactDOM to access and modify the DOM. 
                       <br>ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. 
                      <br><br>
                        <code>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'<br>
                        ReactDOM.render(element, container, callback)</code>
                        <br><br>
                        This method can take maximum of three parameters
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Element:</strong>This parameter expects a JSX expression or a React Element to be rendered.</li>
                          <li><strong>Container:</strong>This parameter expects the container in which the element has to be rendered.</li>
                          <li><strong>Callback:</strong>This is an optional parameter that expects a function that is to be executed once the render is complete.</li>
                      </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="main-section" id="Components">
                      <header>Components</header>
                      <p>
                        A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI.
                        <br><br>
                      <pre><code>class Democomponent extends React.Component
              {
                  render(){
                        return &lt;h1&gt;Welcome Message!&lt;/h1&gt;;
                  }
              }</code></pre>
                      </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="main-section" id="Props">
                      <header>Props</header>
                      <p>
                        Till now we were working with components using static data only. Now, we will learn about how we can pass information to a Component.
              
              React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties). Props are basically kind of global variable or object. 
                        <br>
                        We can pass props to any component as we declare attributes for any HTML tag. Have a look at the below code snippet:
                        <pre>
                      <code>&lt;DemoComponent sampleProp = "HelloProp" /&gt;</code></pre>
                      In the above code snippet, we are passing a prop named sampleProp to the component named DemoComponent. This prop has a value “HelloProp”. Let us now see how can we access these props.<br>
              We can access any props inside from the component’s class to which the props is passed. The props can be accessed as shown below:
                      <br><br>
                      <code>this.props.propName;</code>
                      <br><br>
                      We can access any prop from inside a component’s class using the above syntax. The ‘this.props’ is a kind of global object which stores all of a components props. The propName, that is the names of props are keys of this object.
                      </p>
                    </section>
                    <section class="main-section" id="State">
                      <header>State</header>
                      <p>
                        The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behaviour of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
                        <br>
                        State of a component should prevail throughout the lifetime, thus we must first have some initial state, to do so we should define the State in the constructor of the component’s class. To define a state of any Class we can use the sample format below. 
                      <br><br>
                      <pre><code>
                      
              Class MyClass extends React.Component 
              { 
                  constructor(props) 
                  { 
                      super(props); 
                      this.state = { attribute : "value" }; 
                  } 
              } 
              
              </code></pre>
                      </p>
                    </section>
                  </main>
                </div>
              </div>
